## Hi There 👾

I'm **Madison Davis**, a designer and developer based in Montana. 

I focus on frontend work and UI/UX design. I love making this pretty and functional. 

I fell in love with cs earlier on, discovered what web design was, and decided I wanted to combine my creativity with my passion for coding and pursue frontend opportunities. 

I've only worked in tech... it's what I love. 

Tech Stack *(so far)*: 
  React
  Typescript
  Javascript
  Python
  HTML/CSS
  Flutter
  Figma 

Most of what I've learned has come from youtube videos, messing around with code, and creating mock designs of existing websites. 


**My Trivia:**
 - I love running
 - I read too often
 - Cats are superior in my mind
 - Slight obsession with Halloween

**Interests**
 - Anime/Manga
 - Pinterest for pretty much anything
 - Designing
